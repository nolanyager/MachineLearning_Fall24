# Data

NRI_Data_By_County.csv:
This data was downloaded from NRI's data resources page (https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/data-resources#csvDownload) in October 2024.
I used table format (CSV), all counties, with county-level detail. 

SVI_2022_Data_By_County.csv: 
This data was downloaded from CDC's ATSDR data page (https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/data_documentation_download.html) in October 2024. I used 2022 data for all of the U.S. 
I used county as geography type in CSV file format. 

The other files are associated with the NRI data. I couldn't bear to delete them, would have been far too harsh of me.
